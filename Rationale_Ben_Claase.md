#### Front-End Web Design

## Winter-term 2019

##### Rationale

The final website design I have produced differs in more than one way from my original concept sketches; in some ways the limitations of CSS have defined the outcome, as I wasn’t able to include javascript to aid the layout and operation, although overall I have learnt that the possibilities within HTML and CSS are greater than I have harnessed in this website project.
I set out to produce a website with non-standard scrolling effects which provide interest and a sense of non-linear movement through the website, and I have achieved part of this in having image containers with a background-fixed image inside of them on the landing and “history” pages (see figure 1). Getting these image containers to work properly in a format that suited the context was tricky and a good exercise in using margin and padding to position elements. If I were to explore front-end web design more in the future, I think I would like to learn more about page animation and how we interact with and navigate through web pages.
The next step was to embed a slideshow of images on both the home/landing page and the “Robin Boyd” page. There are plenty of tutorials available for creating a slideshow for a web page, and I decided to create something of the simple sort for this website. So I found, the trick to having the slideshow work correctly is generally the image sizing and therefore the container sizes. Clearly it’s neater if all of the images are the same size as their position won’t shift when the image changes, but it also helps in calculating the overall size of the image container so it scrolls the correct distance between images. This was another exercise in making sure every detail of formatting is correct, otherwise the slideshow simply doesn’t show on the page or won’t slide. Both the slideshow and the scroll effects showed me that it’s never as simple as I’d hoped, and both elements needed some serious de-bugging before they appeared on the page as I intended.
It took a fair amount of researching and reading about responsive CSS to make the website scale appropriately for viewing on different screen sizes - the syntax for creating a grid layout proved harder than anticipated. In the end I decided that my layout could be described with auto margins and didn’t really require a grid, although I still had to scale the text appropriately. The text scaling I found easier, the concept of a unit that’s relative to a specified size (em) isn’t too hard to grasp and it was fairly easy to calculate and edit throughout the CSS document.
I can see many areas I’d like to improve in my understanding of HTML and CSS, it’s clear that the rabbit hole goes much deeper. I don’t think that I’ve created what I set out to achieve with my proposal sketches, but it’s been a valuable process nonetheless.

### Research Resources

There are plenty of YouTube tutorials on HTML and CSS, and I found this to be a valuable source of information.
